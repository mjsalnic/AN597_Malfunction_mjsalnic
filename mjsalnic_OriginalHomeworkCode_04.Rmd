## Challenges
## Problem 1: 
The biggest issue is writing the function code. I didn't include all the parameters and only try one sample Z-test.
Also, I cannot include the equation in the plot

## Problem 2: 
I cannot bind two data frames to create the plot for predicted CI and the plot for the linear regression
I have no idea how to fix that
 #Conolidating all data into one dataframe: Error in data.frame(..., check.names = FALSE) : 
  arguments imply differing number of rows: 213, 128


# Question 1
[1] Write a simple R function, Z.prop.test(), that can perform one- or two-sample Z-tests for proportion data, using the following guidelines:
Your function should take the following arguments: p1 and n1 (no default) representing the estimated proportion and sample size (i.e., based on your sample data); p2 and n2 (both defaulting to NULL) that contain a second sample’s proportion and sample size data in the event of a two-sample test; p0 (no default) as the expected value for the population proportion; and alternative (default “two.sided”) and conf.level (default 0.95), to be used in the same way as in the function t.test().
When conducting a two-sample test, it should be p1 that is tested as being smaller or larger than p2 when alternative=“less” or alternative=“greater”, the same as in the use of x and y in the function t.test().

The function should perform a one-sample Z-test using p1, n1, and p0 if either p2 or n2 (or both) is NULL.

The function should contain a check for the rules of thumb we have talked about (n∗p>5 and n∗(1−p)>5) to ensure the validity of assuming the normal distribution in both the one- and two-sample settings. If this is violated, the function should still complete but it should also print an appropriate warning message.
The function should return a list containing the members Z (the test statistic), P (the appropriate p value), and CI (the two-sided CI with respect to “conf.level” around p1 in the case of a one-sample test and around p2-p1 in the case of a two-sample test). For all test alternatives (“two.sided”, “greater”, “less”), calculate symmetric CIs based on quantiles of the normal distribution rather than worrying about calculating single-limit confidence bounds.



```{r writing a fucntion for z. prop test}
Z.prop.test  <- function(x,n,p=NULL,conf.level=0.95,alternative="less") {
   ts.z <- NULL
   cint <- NULL
   p.val <- NULL
      phat <- x/n  #estimated proportion
      qhat <- 1 - phat
     
      if(length(p) > 0) { 
         q <- 1-p
         SE.phat <- sqrt((p*q)/n) 
         ts.z <- (phat - p)/SE.phat
         p.val <- pnorm(ts.z)
         if(alternative=="two.sided") {
            p.val <- p.val * 2
         }
         if(alternative=="greater") {
            p.val <- 1 - p.val
         }
       
      } 
       cint <- phat + c( 
         -1*((qnorm(((1 - conf.level)/2) + conf.level))*SE.phat),
         ((qnorm(((1 - conf.level)/2) + conf.level))*SE.phat) )
           
   return(list(estimate=phat,ts.z=ts.z,p.val=p.val,cint=cint))
      }
      
Z.prop.test(150,360, p=0.90)
```


# Question 2
The dataset from Kamilar and Cooper has in it a large number of variables related to life history and body size. For this exercise, the end aim is to fit a simple linear regression model to predict longevity (MaxLongevity_m) measured in months from species’ brain size (Brain_Size_Species_Mean) measured in grams. Do the following for both longevity~brain size and log(longevity)~log(brain size):


z.test(312,360, p=0.9)
```{r}
library(curl)
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN597_Fall19/KamilarAndCooperData.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
head(d)
```

## 1. 
Fit the regression model and, using {ggplot2}, produce a scatterplot with the fitted line superimposed upon the data. Append the the fitted model equation to your plot (HINT: use the function geom_text()).

## 2. 
Identify and interpret the point estimate of the slope (β1), as well as the outcome of the test associated with the hypotheses H0: β1 = 0; HA: β1 ≠ 0. Also, find a 90 percent CI for the slope (β1) parameter.

## 3. 
Using your model, add lines for the 90 percent confidence and prediction interval bands on the plot and add a legend to differentiate between the lines.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(car)


m<- lm(data = d, MaxLongevity_m ~ Brain_Size_Species_Mean)
m
summary(m)
plot(m$residuals)
qqnorm(m$residuals)
confint(m, level = 0.90)
qqPlot(m$residuals)

```



```{r}
g <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = Brain_Size_Species_Mean, y = MaxLongevity_m))
g <- g + geom_point()
g <- g + geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
g

# Calculating confidence intervals
temp_var <- predict(m, interval="prediction")
temp_var

# Conolidating all data into one dataframe
#new_df<- cbind (d, temp_var) ### does not work

#head(new_df)



#ggplot(data= new_df)+ aes(x= Brain_Size_Species_Mean, y= MaxLongevity_m)+
    #geom_point() +
    #geom_line(aes(y=lwr), color = "red", linetype = "dashed")+
    #geom_line(aes(y=upr), color = "red", linetype = "dashed")+
    #geom_smooth(method=lm, se=TRUE)+
   
```




```{r data model scatter plot, added headline }



## headlines
ggplotRegression <- function (fit) {

require(ggplot2)

ggplot(fit$model, aes_string(x = names(fit$model)[2], y = names(fit$model)[1])) + 
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") +
  labs(title = paste("Adj R2 = ",signif(summary(fit)$adj.r.squared, 5),
                     "Intercept =",signif(fit$coef[[1]],5 ),
                     " Slope =",signif(fit$coef[[2]], 5),
                     " P =",signif(summary(fit)$coef[2,4], 5)))
}


ggplotRegression(lm(data = d, MaxLongevity_m ~ Brain_Size_Species_Mean))
```


## 4. 
Produce a point estimate and associated 90 percent PI for the longevity of a species whose brain weight is 800 gm. Do you trust the model to predict observations accurately for this value of the explanatory variable? Why or why not?

```{r question 4}
ci<- predict(m, newdata = data.frame(Brain_Size_Species_Mean = 800), interval = "confidence", level = 0.90)

ci

PI<- predict(m, newdata = data.frame(Brain_Size_Species_Mean = 800), interval = "prediction", level = 0.90)

PI
```


## Log data model


```{r  log data model}
d$logMaxLongevity<-log(d$MaxLongevity_m)
d$logBrain_Size_Species_Mean<-log(d$Brain_Size_Species_Mean)
plot(data=d, logMaxLongevity~logBrain_Size_Species_Mean)

model<-lm(data=d, logMaxLongevity~logBrain_Size_Species_Mean)
model
summary(model)
plot(model)
qqnorm(model$residuals)
confint(model, level = 0.90)
```


```{r log data model scatter plot, added headline}

g1 <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = logBrain_Size_Species_Mean, y = logMaxLongevity))
g1 <- g1 + geom_point()
g1 <- g1 + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
g1

ggplotRegression(lm(data = d, logMaxLongevity ~ logBrain_Size_Species_Mean))
```
5. Looking at your two models, which do you think is better? Why?



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
